# _buildspaceWaveProject
_buildspace course project which combines a Solidity smart contract with a React UI.
Send a message along with a "wave" and log that transaction on the Rinkeby testnet. Users can go to the site, wave, and top wavers are ranked by total number of waves over time. 
There is a built-in random prize of Rinkeby ETH that uses block difficulty, as a seed for a more secure "randomness" (RNG not supported in Solidity at this time).
